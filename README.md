This project was developed in 2010 at Politehnica University of Bucharest by Mihai Paraschiv, Irina Tudose, Bogdan Benea, Florin Popescu and Alexandru Salajan. Our desire was to create a framework on top of which various news topic exploring applications can be developed. Development was stalled and the current version is just a proof of concept.
